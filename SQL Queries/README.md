# SQL Queries

Welcome to the **SQL Queries** folder of this repository. This section contains a collection of my SQL work, ranging from basic queries to advanced data manipulation and optimization techniques.

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

- **Beginner Queries**: Simple `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `JOIN` examples.
- **Intermediate Queries**: Subqueries, aggregations, window functions, and `GROUP BY` usage.
- **Advanced Queries**: Complex joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), recursive queries, stored procedures, performance tuning, and more.

## 💡 Purpose

This folder is intended to serve as:

- A learning resource for those starting with SQL.
- A reference for intermediate and advanced SQL users.
- A personal archive of my SQL practice, projects, and experiments.

## 🛠️ SQL Dialects

The queries may include syntax or features specific to:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server
- SQLite

> Each file or section will specify the SQL dialect used if necessary.

## 🚀 How to Use

You can browse through the `.sql` files, run them in your preferred SQL environment, and adapt them for your own use cases.
